The provided code has a couple of issues that need to be addressed:

1. The initial value of `reversed_num` should be `0`, not `10`. Starting with `10` would lead to an incorrect result.
2. The code assumes that the input number (`num`) is an integer, but it does not handle non-integer inputs or negative numbers.

Here's the corrected code with input validation and error handling:

```python
def reverse_number(num):
    # Check if the input is a positive integer
    if not isinstance(num, int) or num < 0:
        return "Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer."

    reversed_num = 0

    while num != 0:
        digit = num % 10
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit
        num //= 10

    return reversed_num

# Test cases
print("Reversed Number:", reverse_number(1234))  # Output: 4321
print("Reversed Number:", reverse_number(-1234))  # Output: Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.
print("Reversed Number:", reverse_number(0))  # Output: 0
print("Reversed Number:", reverse_number(12.34))  # Output: Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.
```

In the corrected code, the `reverse_number` function takes a single argument `num`. It first checks if the input is a positive integer using the `isinstance` and `<` operators. If the input is invalid, it returns an error message.

If the input is valid, the function initializes `reversed_num` to `0` and enters a loop. Inside the loop, it extracts the last digit of `num` using the modulus operator `%`, appends it to `reversed_num`, and then removes the last digit from `num` using integer division `//=`.

The loop continues until `num` becomes `0`, meaning all digits have been processed. Finally, the function returns the `reversed_num`.

The code also includes test cases to demonstrate the usage of the `reverse_number` function with valid and invalid inputs.

Total number of errors found: 2

1. Initial value of `reversed_num` was set to `10` instead of `0`.
2. No input validation or error handling for non-integer or negative inputs.
